Chapter 1
The Call
Max’s POV
	Max here. Right now, I am with Jake, Ash, Wendy, and Chloe along with 3 new people: Jason, Paul, and Martha. We are at a base on a planet that’s not Earth, because we just got teleported here. This planet seems…abandoned and in ruins. Let me catch you up.
	So, Ash, Chloe, Wendy, Jake, and I were at our school, Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona. We were in History class, taking notes. That was when my phone rang.
	Right now, I’m wearing a white shirt, jeans, some sneakers, and a hoodie. Ash is wearing a blue polo shirt, with jeans and sneakers. Jake is wearing a leather jacket, jeans, and sneakers. Chloe is wearing a pink shirt, jeans, and heels. Wendy is wearing a purple shirt, jeans, and heels. 
	“Turn your phone on silent, Max,” Jake whispered. I took my phone out of my pocket. I was about to put it on silent, until I looked at who was calling. I sighed, because it was Sarah from the hero agency. I raised my hand.`
	“Yes, Max?” our teacher, Mr. Pruett asked. Mr. Pruett was wearing his dress shirt, a tie, dress pants and dress shoes. He had dark brown hair and sea green eyes.
	“Can Ash, Jake, Wendy, Chloe and I go out into the hallway?” I asked. 
	“Why?” Mr. Pruett asked. I walked up to Mr. Pruett’s desk and showed him that the hero agency was calling. Mr. Pruett looked at me. He knit his eyebrows, then raised an eyebrow, as if I was making a joke, but I stared at him, my face showing no emotion, my expression dead serious.
	“Is that…?” 
Mr. Pruett’s voice faded with shock. I nodded. 
	“So, should I answer it, or should I have the government come get me, or what should I do?” I whispered. 
	“You guys can go out into the hallway.” 
	“Thanks.” 
	I motioned for Ash, Chloe, Wendy, and Jake to follow me out into the hallway. They got up, knitting their eyebrows in confusion, and went outside. 
	“What, Max? Why are we here?” Ash asked. 
	“We have an issue.” 
	“What issue?” Jake asked. 
I showed them my phone and that Sarah was calling. 
	“Why is she calling?” Wendy asked. 
	“How should I know? What do you expect me to do, ask why she’s calling?”
	“Guys! Stop arguing and answer the phone!” Chloe snapped. 
	I didn’t want to argue with her, so I answered it. Sure enough, it was Sarah. I turned my speaker on. 
	“Oh, thank god you finally answered!” Sarah said in relief. 
	“This better be good, Sarah. We’re in school.” 
	“Yes, I am aware you’re in school. Anyway, this is important. A man named Harold Garbridge, who is the general of a base on a planet called Barthow, requested me to bring him 8 heroes. You are 5 of them.” 
	Everyone stared at me. They were expecting an answer. I shook my head, looking confused, as I did not have an answer. 
	“What’s going on?” Ash mouthed. 
	I shrugged, and mouthed, “I have no idea.” 
	“Okay…Why does Harold need 8 heroes?” I asked. 
	“His family and power crystals got taken, and his planet, Barthow is under attack by a man named Drake Stoneridge. Plus, his base lost power.” 
	“So…Why does he need us?” Jake asked. 
	 “He needs help defeating Drake, along with fixing his base.” 
	“How does he expect 8 teenagers to do this? Especially if I cannot focus. You know I have ADHD!” 
	“Simple answer: Max is great with tools, so he can help with the base. And correct me if  I’m wrong, but do you still have that toolbelt from the last quest?” 
	“Yeah, I do.” 
	“Great! So, you can help fix the base.” 
	I sighed. Clearly, she wouldn’t let us out of this. 
	“Okay. We will do it. How do we get to Barthow?” 
	“You will be teleported. Just tell me when you’re ready.” 
	“Got it.” 
	We walked back into the classroom and grabbed our backpacks. We started to walk out, but Mr. Pruett walked in front of us and blocked the door. He raised an eyebrow.
	“Woah. Where do you think you’re going?” Mr. Pruett demanded. 
	“Um…” Ash couldn’t get himself to say it. So, I said it for him. 
	“We’re going to save the world. Bye.” 
	We started to move around Mr. Pruett, but he blocked us again.
	“Not so fast, guys. What are you doing?” Mr. Pruett asked.
	“I just told you. We’re going to save the world,” I said.
	“Yeah, this had better be a joke, Max,” Mr. Pruett said.
	“Would I joke about the world ending?” I asked. Mr. Pruett shrugged.
	“With you, it’s hard to tell. Jake, is he telling the truth?” Mr. Pruett asked. Jake nodded.
	“Yes, Mr. Pruett. He is telling the truth,” Jake said.
	“Is there any way to talk you out of this?” Mr. Pruett asked with hope in his voice. I shook my head.
	“Nope.”
	Mr. Pruett sighed.
	“Okay. Go save the world,” he said.
	We walked out, but I turned.
	“Do we get extra credit if we survive?”
	“Max, come on!” Ash said. 
	“But do we? I need it since I’m failing.” 
	Mr. Pruett chuckled.
	“If you survive that long, then sure.” 
	I walked out of the classroom. 
	“Alright, Sarah. We are ready. How is this going to work?” 
	“Look under your shoes,” Sarah said.
	“Uhh, why?” I asked, weirded out.
	“Just do it and tell me if there’s a golden light,” Sarah instructed.
	It was weird, but we looked under our shoes. Sure enough, there was a golden light.
	“Yes, there is a golden light,” I said.
	“Okay, good. The light will rise until it covers your faces,” Sarah said.
	“What happens after it covers our faces?” Jake asked.
	“Once the light covers your faces, you should be teleported,” Sarah explained.
	“Got it,” Ash said.
	“Where is the light at now?” Sarah asked.
	We looked down to see the light was creeping up our chests.
	“It’s at our chests,” I replied.
	“Excellent! You should be teleported any minute now,” Sarah said.
	We waited. A few seconds later, the light covered our faces and we teleported. When the light faded, we were on a place that was NOT Earth. It seemed like a completely different planet. Not to mention, this planet that we teleported to was in ruins and seemed abandoned. We looked around. There was not anything interesting, except for the massive base in front of us. I stared at it.
	“Max? What’s up, buddy?” Jake asked. 
	“Nothing. I’m just looking at this base. We should go in.”
	“Absolutely not,” Ash said. 
	“Aww! Why not?” I complained. 
	“Because who knows what could be in there? There could be really bad people inside.” 
	“So? If there are bad people, we can fight them. Besides, why would Sarah send us here if the base had bad people?” I asked.  
Ash’s POV
	“That’s true. Okay, fine. We can go in. But stay alert and stick together.” 
	Too late. Before I could finish talking, Max was already inside, gawking at everything. I sighed, then looked at Jake. 
	“Jake, will you please try to keep your boyfriend under control?” I asked. Jake nodded. 
	“Got it.” 
	Jake walked ahead. Chloe walked up to me, with Wendy behind her. I took a breath from relief and exhaustion. 
	“Hey,” I said. 
	“Hey, Ash. How are you holding up?” Chloe asked. I shrugged. 
	“Honestly, I’m not 100% on board.” 
	“What do you mean?” Wendy asked. 
	“I mean I’m not sure if I want to save the world, or whatever.” 
	“But we’re heroes. It’s our job,” Chloe said.
	“I know, but sometimes I wish I weren’t a hero. That way I could, you know, have a normal life. I wish I was a normal teenager who didn’t have to risk his life almost every day and not have to worry or think about if I’ll die or not,” I admitted.
	“I get that but think about the feeling we get after knowing we’ve saved lives. Do you really want to give that up?” Wendy asked. She had a point. I shook my head. 
	“No, I don’t.” 
	“That’s good to hear. Are you ready to go inside the base?” Wendy asked.
I nodded. 
	“Yeah. Even if I am not, we should still go in after Max. Just because Jake is there with him, that does not mean Max won’t try to get Jake roped in and goof off with him. Come on. Let us go,” I said. We walked into the base.
Max’s POV
	I ran inside the base before Ash could finish talking. Instantly after I walked in, I stopped and looked around. Sure, it was just a hallway, and it was in ruins, but somehow, I could see what it looked like before it got destroyed, or whatever, and what I saw was an amazingly built structure. The top and bottom had a gold trim. It was a shame this was in ruins, but that was not a big problem. I could fix it, or even improve it. However, I could not stop. I had to keep moving. I walked to the end of the hallway to see a door. There were 2 buttons: a red one, and a black one, which was below a speaker. Just then, I heard Jake. 
	“Max? You in here?” Jake called. 
	“I’m at the end of the hallway,” I called. Jake walked over to me. I was still looking at the buttons. Jake saw what I was looking at. 
	“Which one do you think opens it?” Jake asked. 
	“I’m guessing the button below the speaker is a doorbell. If that is the case, I’m assuming the red button opens the door.” 
	I reached for the button to press it; my palm open. A small yellow light shone in my hand. I knew that light was not there before. So, if the light was not there before, then…I flipped my hand over so that my palm was facing up. And on my palm, there was a small flame. I was afraid this would happen. I had sworn to never do it again. Not after the incident. Jake saw, and his eyes widened. 
	“Max, what? I thought you said you wouldn’t do it again.” 
	“I know I said that.” 
	“They why-?” 
	“I didn’t know it would happen.” 
	My eyes began to water as I remembered the incident: the day Uncle Mark died. His workshop had burned down, and he was still inside. His death was all my fault. Jake saw my eyes watering, and he knew what I was thinking. 
	“It wasn’t your fault.” 
I did not have to ask what he was talking about. 
	“Yes, it was.” 
	“How was it your fault? You hadn’t realized it would happen.” 
	“But I knew about my powers. Everyone in the family did. If only I had been more careful…” 
	“But you didn’t know it would happen.” 
	“Exactly. Well, technically I knew.” I said. 
	“What do you mean?” 
	“I felt this urge…This…feeling in my mind. I heard a voice.” 
	“A voice?” 
I nodded.
	“What did it say?” 
	“It told me I knew I had to do it. It urged me to do it.” 
	“And you did.” 
I nodded. A few tears came down. Jake hugged me. 
	“Hey, bud. Don’t worry. Whoever or whatever the voice is that you heard, we’ll find out who or what it is, okay?” Jake asked. 
I nodded. 
	“Alright.” 
We heard footsteps from the entrance of the base. We turned to see Ash and the girls. 
	“Hey boys,” Chloe said. 
	“Hey,” I muttered. 
	“Is Max okay?” Wendy asked. 
	“No, I’m not okay. Not at all.” 
	“Max, what’s wrong?” Ash asked. I opened my palm. As expected, a flame appeared. 
Ash and the girls stared at it. 
	“Max-.” 
	“It’s back…” 
	“But you swore-.” 
	“I know what I said! I didn’t know this would happen, even though I had an urge.” 
	Everybody stared at me, and nobody spoke for a minute or two. Jake broke the silence. 
	“We shouldn’t stand around. We should go in.” 
Everyone looked at me. 
	“What? Why is everyone looking at me?” I demanded. 
	“Are you going to open the door, or what?” Ash asked. 
	I stared at the red button, then at my hands, which were shaking with fear. I jerked my hand back and put it in my pocket. 
	“You okay?” Jake asked. 
	“No, I’m not. I can’t open the door.”
	“Why not?” Ash asked. 
	“Look at my hands! Do you not see this?” I demanded. 
	“Okay, so your hands can be on fire. Why can’t you open the door because of that?” 
	“I don’t want to open the door because I’m scared that I’ll burn something.” 
	“Oh. Well then, I’ll open the door.” 
	Ash pressed the red button, and the door opened, revealing a room with 3 hallways: one to the left, middle, and right. We walked into the hallway to the left. Inside was a room filled with armor. We walked out and then went into the hallway to the right. Inside was a room filled with weapons of all sorts: from bows and staffs to swords and shotguns. 
	“Dude, this is awesome,” I said. 
	We walked out and then went into the middle room, which was a hallway. We walked until we had to open a door. We opened the door, and it was a room filled with computers, tools, etc. To our right was a door. We opened it to see another hallway, which stretched for some time before we turned left, still in the hallway. After a bit of walking, we made it to another door, but it was open. 
	The five of us looked at each other. It was clear that we were thinking the same thing: Why was this door open? Are there other people here besides us and the employees? If so, why are all the other doors closed but this one? Why didn’t the employees move or react near us? A million questions flooded my mind. After a few minutes of standing there, my hand moved up. 
As my hand moved, I felt heat in my hand. 
	‘Please, no. Whoever or whatever is doing this, make it stop,’ I pleaded in my head. 
	‘Why should we make it stop? This is what you were born for. The fire in your hands is not a curse. It is a gift. Use it to the best of your ability,’ a voice said in my head. 
I shook my head. 
	‘No. I swore to never use it again. Not after last time.’ 
Jake shook me and snapped me back into reality. 
	“Max? Max! Are you okay?” Jake asked. 
	“Huh? What happened?” 
	“You moved your hand, and then you stopped moving. It was like you were frozen. What happened?” 
	“I-.” 
	I wanted to tell them, but I was a little bit scared. I did not know how they would feel.
	“I’ll tell you later.” 
	“What-?” 
	“Let’s just go inside.” 
	We walked inside. It seemed like a lounge: there was a TV, a couch, a fridge, cabinets stocked with snacks, etc. 
	“Now this is nice,” I said.
	I must admit, we were so distracted that we did not even notice the 2 boys and girl staring at us as we were goofing off. 
	“Hey! What are you doing?” a voice demanded. 
I thought it was Ash. 
	“Ash! Can’t you see I’m busy?” I snapped. 
	“Who is Ash?” the voice asked. 
The voice was female. I looked up. 
	“Uh, hi,” Jake said. 
	“Hello. What are your names?” The girl asked. She was pretty. I walked over to her. 
	“My name’s Max. And you are? Wait, do not tell me. You are a beautiful young lady waiting to fall in love. Fear not, as I am here,” I said. 
The girl looked at me in annoyance. 
	“You’re such a freak,” she said. 
Ash stepped in between us.
	“Sorry about Max. My name’s Ash. That is Jake, Wendy, and Chloe. What about you? What are your names?” Ash asked. 
	“Jason, Paul and Martha,” Jason said. 
	“Nice to meet you guys,” I said. 
	“Nice to meet you too,” Paul said. 
	“So, what do we do now? What are we even supposed to be doing?” I asked. 
	“We’re supposed to be helping Harold,” Jake said. I nodded. 
	“Oh yes. You are right. Where even is Harold?” I asked. After I asked that, a man walked into the lounge. He saw us, and his expression changed from normal to surprised and shocked. 
	“Hey! Who are you? How did you get in here?” the man demanded. 
	“Are you Harold Garbridge?” Jake asked. The man nodded but looked surprised. 
	“I-I am! How did you know that?” Harold asked in surprise. 
	“We got teleported here by Sarah from the hero agency. I think we’re the eight heroes you need,” Ash said. 

Jason’s POV
	My name is Jason Bell. Let me tell you how my best friend, Paul Turner and I got to Barthow. We were in English class, reading our books while Ms. Margaret, our teacher, was talking. That was when Paul’s phone rang. Ms. Margaret looked up.
	“Whose phone was that?” she demanded. Paul raised his hand nervously.
	“Mine, sorry. Can I see who it is?” Paul asked. Ms. Margaret nodded. Paul took out his phone to see who was calling. When he saw who was calling, Paul slapped his hand over his mouth. He shot his hand up in the air.
	“Yes, Paul?” Ms. Margaret asked.
	“Can Jason and I go out into the hall?” Paul asked. I looked up, not expecting to be involved with this. Ms. Margaret raised an eyebrow, casting Paul a confused look.
	“Why do you need to go out into the hall?” Ms. Margaret asked.
	“To answer my phone,” Paul said.
	“Why can’t you answer it here?”
	“Because it’s important and might be private.”
	“Okay, so if it’s important and private, why does Jason have to go out into the hall?” Ms. Margaret asked.
	“He needs to be involved with what has to be said,” Paul insisted.
	“Is there any way I can talk you out of this?” Ms. Margaret asked with a hint of hope in her voice. Paul shook his head.
	“No, there is not,” Paul said. Ms. Margaret sighed.
	“Okay, you guys can go out into the hall,” Ms. Margaret said. Her tone made it clear she was going to regret her decision.
	Paul went out into the hall and motioned for me to follow. I went out into the hall, closing the door behind me. When I got out into the hall, I saw Paul was pacing and muttering nervously.
	“Oh my god, this is crazy!” Paul muttered nervously.
	“Paul, is everything okay?” I asked. He didn’t respond or notice me, as he was too busy muttering and pacing.
	“Paul, who’s calling?” I asked in a louder tone. Paul noticed me that time. He rushed over to me, a panicked look on his face.
	“Jason! This is crazy!” Paul exclaimed.
	“Who’s calling?” I repeated.
	“Do you know that hero agency in California?” Paul asked. I nodded.
	“Yeah, I’ve heard of them. Why?” I asked.
	“They’re calling me!” Paul exclaimed.
	“Wait what?” I asked in surprise. Paul nodded and showed me his phone. Sure enough, the contact name read “Hero Agency”. I knit my eyebrows and gave Paul a confused look.
	“How do you know it’s not a random person saying they’re the hero agency?” I asked in a confused tone.
	“I added them to my contacts,” Paul admitted.
	“You’re a stalker.”
	“I am not! Oh, man, Jason! What do I do? Jason, you have to help me!” Paul said. His tone made it clear he was freaking out.
	“Stop freaking out and answer the phone!” I instructed him. Paul answered the phone.
	“Hello? H-hero agency?” Paul managed to ask.
	“Hello. I’m Sarah from the hero agency. What is your name?” Sarah asked. I reached for Paul’s phone but waited for his permission. He nodded and I grabbed it.
	“Jason Bell and Paul Turner,” I said.
	“Nice to meet you guys,” Sarah said.
	“Nice to meet you too. Hey, Sarah. I have a question.”
	“Yes, Paul?”
	“Why are you calling me?” Paul asked.
	“I’m calling because a man named Harold Garbridge had his planet Barthow invaded and his family and power crystals were stolen by a man named Drake Stoneridge,” Sarah said. Paul and I exchanged confused looks.
	“So, why are you calling…?” I asked.
	“I’m calling to say that Harold requested eight heroes. You are two of them,” Sarah said.
	“Oh, okay. So, where are we going?” I asked.
	“You’ll be going to the planet Barthow,” Sarah said.
	“How will we get there?” Paul asked.
	“I’ll teleport you,” Sarah said.
	“Oh, cool. Wait, did you say you’ll teleport us?” Paul asked in surprise.
	“Yes, I did.”
	“How will that work?” I asked.
	“I’ll explain when you guys are ready,” Sarah said.
	“Okay. We’ll go tell our teacher,” Paul said.
	We walked back into the classroom and went up to Ms. Margaret’s desk.
	“Ms. Margaret, can we talk to you out in the hall?” Paul whispered. Ms. Margaret nodded and followed us out into the hall, closing the door behind her.
	“So, you wanted to talk to me?” Ms. Margaret asked. We nodded.
	“Yeah, we do,” Paul said.
	“About what?” Ms. Margaret asked. Paul hesitated, as he was nervous.
	“This is going to sound crazy,” Paul said. Ms. Margaret chuckled.
	“Paul, please. I deal with five classes of forty kids five days a week. I think I can handle whatever it is you have to say,” Ms. Margaret said. Paul took a deep breath, getting himself ready to tell Ms. Margaret about the call.
	“We just got asked to help a man get his family and some sort of crystals back from another man and they live on a planet called Barthow with six other people,” Paul blurted, going faster by the word. When he finished, Ms. Margaret stared at Paul in concern and confusion.
	“Paul, are you feeling okay? Do I need to send you to the nurse?” Ms. Margaret asked in a concerned expression.
	“I’m not crazy and I’m not making this up, I swear! Ask Jason, he’ll tell you the truth!” Paul insisted. Ms. Margaret’s gazed went from Paul to me.
	“Jason, is Paul telling the truth?” Ms. Margaret asked. I nodded.
	“Yes, Ms. Margaret. Paul is telling the truth,” I said. Ms. Margaret crossed her arms and gave Paul and I a skeptical look.
	“I don’t believe you,” she said. Paul and I stared at Ms. Margaret in shock and disbelief.
	“What? But, Ms. Margaret, we are telling the truth! Ask Sarah! She’s from the hero agency! She’ll tell you the whole truth,” I insisted. Ms. Margaret shrugged.
	“Okay then. Sarah, is this true? Are Jason and Paul and six other people going to help get these crystals back?” Ms. Margaret asked. She had a smirk on her face, showing her reaction if Sarah said we were lying. Ms. Margaret was not ready for the truth.
	“Yes, ma’am, that is true. Jason, Paul and six others have been chosen as heroes to help Harold get his family and power crystals back from an evil warlord named Drake Stoneridge,” Sarah said. Ms. Margaret’s jaw dropped in shock and surprise, as she wasn’t expecting Sarah to say that.
	“So, can we go?” Paul asked with hope in his voice. Ms. Margaret sighed, making it clear she was going to regret her decision either way. Finally, she nodded.
	“Yes, I guess you can go,” Ms. Margaret grumbled. Her tone made it clear she wasn’t happy with her choice. Paul and I exchanged confused glances, then gave Ms. Margaret a confused look.
	“Really? You’re letting us go?” Paul asked in surprise. Ms. Margaret nodded.
	“Yeah, I am. Now, go save the world, heroes,” Ms. Margaret said. She walked back into the classroom.
	“Alright, Sarah. We’re ready to be teleported,” Paul said.
	“Okay.”
	“So, how will this work?” I asked.
	“Look under your shoes,” Sarah said. Paul and I exchanged nervous and confused glances.
	“Uhh, why?” Paul asked in a confused tone.
	“Just do it,” Sarah instructed. It was weird, but we did what Sarah instructed. We looked under our shoes to see a gold light.
	“Paul, you see the gold light too, right?” I asked. Paul nodded.
	“Yeah, I do. Why?” Paul asked.
	“I just wanted to make sure I’m not going crazy. Sarah, why is there a golden light under our shoes?” I asked.
	“That golden light is how I’ll teleport you to Barthow,” Sarah said.
	“What do you mean? How can a light teleport us?” Paul asked.
	“Well, the light will rise from under your shoe to above your shoe and so on until it covers your faces,” Sarah said.
	“What happens when it covers our faces?” I asked.
	“Once the light covers your faces, you should be teleported,” Sarah explained.
	“Oh, okay,” Paul said.
	“Where is the light at now?” Sarah asked.
	We looked down to see the light was creeping up our chests.
	“It’s at our chests,” I replied.
	“Excellent! You should be teleported any second,” Sarah said.
	We waited. A few seconds later, the light covered our faces and we teleported. When the light faded, we weren’t in the hall. In fact, we weren't even at school. We were standing on a rocky ground.
“Did it work? What do you see?” Sarah asked.
“Well, we're not at school,  so I think it worked. And we see a base,” I said. Paul and I looked at the base and grinned.
“Should we?” Paul asked. I didn’t need to ask what he was talking about. I knew what Paul wanted, and I wanted it too. I nodded.
“Let’s do it,” I said.
“Hey, Sarah. We’re going to go into the base. Bye, “ I said.
“Okay, bye,” Sarah said.
Paul and I walked into the base,  opening doors until we reached what looked like a lounge. When we got into the lounge, we saw Martha.
“Hey, Martha,” I said. Martha was reading, so I guess she didn’t hear me. I repeated what I said, and she noticed me that time. She looked up from her book.
“Oh, hey. Sorry I didn’t hear you. I was reading,” Martha said. I shrugged
“It’s all good. What are you reading?” I asked.
“Book 3 of Treasure Hunters,” Martha said. My eyes widened in eagerness.
“No way, that’s my favorite series!” I exclaimed.
“I know!” Martha said. I looked at Martha, weirded out..
“You know?” I asked, weirded out. Martha chuckled.
“Oh, um. I know because I heard you and your friends talking about how it was your favorite series,” Martha said. She chuckled. Her chuckle sounded nervous, but I didn’t want to let her know. I shrugged.
“Oh. Alright. So, what are you doing here?” I asked.
“Me? Oh, nothing. I just got teleported here by Sarah from the hero agency to help out as a hero, I guess,” Martha said. I smiled.
“No way, so did I! I guess we’ll be doing this together,” I said. Martha smiled weakly.
“That’s…great,” Martha said. Her tone sounded nervous, but I decided not to ask about why she sounded nervous. Just then, we heard footsteps. We turned to see five people: 3 boys and 2 girls, standing there.
“Uh, hi,” a boy said. He had blonde hair and blue eyes.
“Hello. Who are you guys?” I asked.
“Max, Jake, Ash, Wendy and Chloe. What about you? Who are you guys?” Max asked.
“I’m Jason. That’s Paul, and this is Martha,” I said.
“Nice to meet you guys,” Max said.
“Nice to meet you too,” Paul said.
“So, what do we do now? What are we even supposed to be doing?” Max asked.
“We’re supposed to be helping Harold,” Jake said. Max nodded.
“Oh yeah. You’re right. Where even is Harold?” Max asked. After he asked that, a man stepped into the lounge. His expression went from calm to surprised.
“Hey! Who are you? How did you get in here?” the man demanded.
“Are you Harold Garbridge?” Jake asked. The man looked surprised but nodded.
“I-I am! How did you know that?” Harold asked.
“We were teleported by Sarah from the hero agency. I think we’re the eight heroes you need,” Ash said.
Martha’s POV
	My name is Martha Jeg, and I’m here to tell you how I got to Barthow. So, I was in my Calculus when my phone rang. I raised my hand. My teacher, Mr. Stoll looked up.
	“Yes, Martha?” Mr. Stoll asked.
	“My phone is ringing. May I go out into the hall and answer it?” I asked. Mr. Stoll nodded. I went out of the classroom and into the hall, closing the door behind me. Once I was out in the hallway, I answered my phone.
	“Hello? Martha here. Who is this?” I asked.
	“Hi, Martha. I’m Sarah from the hero agency,” Sarah said.
	“Is this some kind of a joke?” I demanded.
	“This is not a joke,” Sarah said in a stern tone.
	“Okay. Why are you calling me, Sarah?” I asked.
	“I’m calling to say that a man named Harold Garbridge had his family and power crystals stolen by a man named Drake Stoneridge.
	“Wait, so why are you calling?” I asked.
	“Harold requested eight heroes. You are one of them,” Sarah said.
	“Wait, I’m confused,” I said.
	“About what?” Sarah asked.
	If I’m one of the heroes, who are the other seven?” I asked.
	“You will find that out shortly,” Sarah said.
	“Okay, so where do I go to help this Harold guy?” I asked.
	“You need to go to a planet called Barthow,” Sarah said.
	“How will I get to Barthow?” I asked.
	“I’ll teleport you,” Sarah said.
	“Oh, okay. Wait, did you say you’ll teleport me?” I asked in surprise.
	“Yes, I did say that.”
	“How will you teleport me?” I asked.
	“I’ll explain when you’re ready,” Sarah said.
	“Okay, I’ll go tell my teacher,” I said. I walked into the classroom and went to Mr. Stoll’s desk.
	“Mr. Stoll, can I speak to you out in the hall?” I asked. Mr. Stoll nodded and went out into the hall, closing the door behind him.
	“What’s up, Martha?” he asked.
	“Okay, this is going to sound crazy,” I started. Mr. Stoll chuckled.
	“Martha, I’m a teacher who deals with 40 kids a day. I think I can handle whatever it is you have to say,” Mr. Stoll said. I took a deep breath, getting myself ready to tell Mr. Stoll about the call.
	“I just got asked to save the world with seven other heroes,” I blurted, going faster by the word. Mr. Stoll stared at me, his expression confused with a hint of concern.
	“Martha, are you feeling okay?” he asked in a confused tone.
	“I’m not making this up, I swear! Here, ask Sarah. She’s from the hero agency. She’ll tell you!” I insisted. Mr. Stoll shrugged.
	“Okay then. Sarah, is this true? Is she telling the truth? Is Martha one of eight heroes needed to save the world?” Mr. Stoll asked. He gave me a look that showed Sarah was going to say it was a lie. Boy, Mr. Stoll was not ready for the truth.
	“Yes, sir, this is true, and Martha is telling the truth. Martha is indeed one of eight heroes needed to save the world,” Sarah said. Mr. Stoll’s jaw dropped in shock and surprise.
	“So, can I go save the world?” I asked. Mr. Stoll nodded.
	“Yeah. Go save the world, Martha,” Mr. Stoll said. He went back into the classroom.
	“Alright, Sarah. I’m ready to be teleported,” I said.
	“Great. Look under your shoes,” Sarah said. That weirded me out.
	“Why?” I asked, weirded out.
	“Just do it and tell me if you see a golden light under your shoes,” Sarah instructed.
	“O-okay,” I said. It was weird, but I did what Sarah asked. I looked under my shoes. Sure enough, there was a golden light under my shoes.
	“Do you see a golden light?” Sarah asked.
	“Yes, there is a golden light under my shoes,” I replied.
	“Okay, excellent. The golden light will be how I teleport you,” Sarah said. That confused me.
	“How will a golden light teleport me?” I asked in a confused tone.
	“So, the light will rise from your below your shoes to above your shoes, and so on, until it covers your face,” Sarah said.
	“Okay. What happens after the golden light covers my face?” I asked.
	“Once the light covers your face, you should be teleported,” Sarah said.
	“Got it. Should I stay on the call or hang up?”
	“I would stay on the call, that way we know it works.”
	“Sounds good,” I said.
	“Where is the light at now?” Sarah asked. I looked down to see the light was creeping up my neck.
	“It’s creeping up my neck,” I said.
	“Excellent! The light should cover your face and you should be teleported any second,” Sarah said.
	“Got it.”
	I waited. A few seconds later, the light covered my face and I teleported. When the light faded, I wasn’t in the hallway anymore. In fact, I wasn’t even at school anymore. I was standing on a rocky sand ground. There was a base in front of me.
	“Did it work? What do you see?” Sarah asked.
	“Well, I’m not at school anymore, so I guess it worked,” I said.
	“Awesome. What do you see?” Sarah asked.
	“I see a base. I’m going to hang up and go inside the base,” I said.
	“Sounds good. Bye,” Sarah said.
	“Alright, bye,” I said.
	I hung up and walked inside of the base. I walked until I found a lounge. I walked into the lounge. There was nobody here, so I decided to take advantage of that and have some quiet time. During that time, I got some of my book read, got a homework assignment done, and took a nap. I was in the middle of reading when I heard footsteps. I turned to see my crush, Jason Bell and his best friend, Paul Turner.
	“Hey, Martha,” Jason said. I pretended I didn’t hear him because I was reading my book.
	“Hey, Martha,” he repeated. I looked up from my book.
	“Oh, hey Jason. Sorry, I didn’t hear you. I was reading,” I said. Jason shrugged.
	“It’s all good. What are you reading?” Jason asked.
	“Book 3 of the Treasure Hunters series,” I said. Jason’s eyes lit up in eagerness and excitement.
	“No way, that’s my favorite series!” Jason exclaimed.
	“I know!” I said in an eager tone. Jason looked at me, weirded out.
	“You know?” he asked. I chuckled nervously.
	“Oh, um. I just heard you talking about it with your friends,” I said. I was hoping he wouldn’t detect my lie in my voice. Jason nodded.
	“Oh, alright. So, what are you doing here?” Jason asked.
	“I got teleported here by Sarah from the hero agency to save the world,” I said. Jason’s eyes widened with excitement.
	“You did? So did I! I guess we’ll be doing this together,” Jason said. I smiled weakly.
	“That’s great,” I said weakly.
	Jason started to say something, but then didn’t because then we heard footsteps. We turned to see five people: 3 boys and 2 girls.
“Uh, hi,” a boy said. He had blonde hair and blue eyes.
“Hello. Who are you guys?” Jason asked.
“Max, Jake, Ash, Wendy and Chloe. What about you? Who are you guys?” Max asked.
“I’m Jason. That’s Paul, and this is Martha,” Jason said.
“Nice to meet you guys,” Max said.
“Nice to meet you too,” Paul said.
“So, what do we do now? What are we even supposed to be doing?” Max asked.
“We’re supposed to be helping Harold,” Jake said. Max nodded.
“Oh yeah. You’re right. Where even is Harold?” Max asked. After he asked that, a man stepped into the lounge. His expression went from calm to surprised.
“Hey! Who are you? How did you get in here?” the man demanded.
“Are you Harold Garbridge?” Jake asked. The man looked surprised but nodded.
“I-I am! How did you know that?” Harold asked.
“We were teleported by Sarah from the hero agency. I think we’re the eight heroes you need,” Ash said.
