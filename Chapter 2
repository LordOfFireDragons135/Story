Chapter 2
The Attack
Max’s POV
	It took Harold a little bit to process what was going on. Once he was calm, he gave us a tour.
	“How long have you eight been in the base for?” Harold asked. I checked my phone. We arrived at 9:45 AM. It was now 10:00 AM. 
	“About 15 minutes,” I estimated. 
	“I see. So, I take it you have not been on the second, third or fourth floor yet. Is that correct?” Harold asked.
	“Yeah, that’s right.” Jason said. 
I admit, Jason seemed like a nice guy. 
	‘Should I talk to him? Would he be fine with my ADHD?’ I thought to myself. I shook my head, clearing the bad thoughts away. I decided to walk over to him. 
	“Hey,” I said. 
	“What’s up?” 
	“Nothing much. You?” 
	“Not too bad. It was funny when Martha was annoyed at you. No offense.” 
	“None taken. Yes. She is cute, but I feel like she’s not one to date. More like one to kill me,” I sighed with a bit of sadness. Jason put a hand on my shoulder. 
	“Hey, don’t worry about it. She wishes Paul and I weren’t around.” 
	“Why is that?” 
Jason shrugged.
	“Honestly, we’re not sure. I remember we used to joke about death, and she snapped. She told us we were being stupid, immature little kids, and never took anything seriously. Now, she is snapped at us before, but if we thought that was bad, this was worse. She looked shaken up, and her breaths were shaky. I assume she was hiding something.” 
	“Oh, I see…” 
	“It’s all cool.” 
	“So, um. Can I tell you something?” 
	“Sure, man. What’s up?” 
	“I’m…ADHD.” 
I braced myself for his reaction. 
	“Me too.” 
	“Huh?” 
	I looked at him like he was joking. His expression was dead serious. Just then, an alarm blared. Harold rushed to the control room, logged onto his computer, then booted up a software. The software had a map of the galaxies on it. In the galaxy we were at, there was a blinking dot. 
	“What’s that blinking dot?” I asked. 
	“There’s an attack on the volcano planet, Maghearth.” 
	“An attack? You mean, like, monsters?” 
	“Indeed.” 
	Half of me hoped he was kidding, while the other half knew that my life was about to get a lot more complicated. 
	“What’s attacking?” Jason asked. 
	“I’m not sure. It looks like…a flaming eagle…?” 
	“What do we have to do?” I asked. 
	“Pick your weapons, get teleported, and fight.” 
	“Let’s do it.” 
	We ran to the weapons room. I picked a flaming sword. Jake picked an ice sword. Ash picked a water sword. Wendy picked a grass sword. Chloe picked a golden sword. Jason picked up a lightning spear. Paul picked up a bow. 
	“Okay. Now what?” Ash asked. 
	“You will be teleported. Stand on the teleport pads, and I’ll get you there.” 
	We did as we instructed and stood on the pads. Shortly after, we were on a volcano-like planet. 
	“Did it work? What do you see?” Harold asked. 
	“Well, it definitely looks like a volcano planet,” I said as I looked around. We were on an island. There was lava all around, and a bridge that led to a town. I pointed to the bridge. 
	“There’s a bridge. Want to head over?” 
	As we walked across the bridge, we could hear screams and we saw something attacking. 
	At first, it looked like the letter Y in flames, but as we got closer, I realized it was not the letter Y. It was a flaming eagle, and it had its head looking down at a man, a woman, and a small boy. I ran over to them. Just as the eagle was about to dive, I moved the family out of the way. 
	“Go get somewhere safe,” I ordered them. The family looked a bit shaken up, and in fear. They were so scared that they could not move. 
	“Ash! Get these people out of here!” 
	Ash nodded and ran over to them, then guided them to safety. I was so distracted; I didn’t notice the eagle shot fire at me. In fact, I did not even feel it. Everyone stared at me in shock and horror. Of course, being me, I had no idea what was going on. 
	“What did I do this time?” I demanded. 
Nobody responded. They just pointed behind me. 
	“What are you-? Oh my god!” 
	Suddenly, it all made sense. I was immune to fire. I stepped towards the flaming eagle. 
	“Max! What are you doing?” Jason demanded. 
	“I’m going to tame it.” 
	“Are you crazy?!” 
	“I mean, yes, kind of. Just trust me. I know what I am doing. At least, I hope.” 
I continued walking slowly. 
	“Easy, boy,” I started. I did not get very far in my talk with him, because he shot a fireball at me. I managed to grab it and throw the fireball into the lava. The eagle squawked at me, as if to ask how I was alive. 
	“You can’t burn me.” 
	I climbed onto the eagle’s back and tried stroking his wings. Yes, that didn’t work, because he flew fast. 
	“Belt, get me some reins!” I said quickly. 
	The belt obeyed, and I pulled out reins. I tied the reins as fast as I could. I was on the last one, and then we hit lava. 
Jake’s POV
	We watched in horror as Max flew into the lava, but there was still hope. 
	“He’s gone.” Ash said. 
I shook my head. 
	“No.” 
	“What do you mean ‘no’? He just hit lava! There’s no way he could have survived!” 
	“He survived the fireball. Lava is a type of fire, right?” 
	“Yeah,” Jason said. 
	“Okay, lava is a type of fire. So?” Ash asked. 
	“So, if Max is immune to fire, and lava is a type of fire, then he could still be alive.” 
After I said that, the ground rumbled, and up came Max. 
Max’s POV
	We dove into the lava. While we were in the lava, well, let us just say I had to yank the reins, a LOT to calm him down. I pinned him against the rocks and forced the eagle to look into my eyes. Only then did I notice the sadness, fear, and worry in his eyes. The poor fire eagle was manipulating from someone, and I had to save him. I reached for his wings, and he freaked out. 
	“Woah, boy! Easy there. I am not going to hurt you. I promise,” I said in a calm voice. 
	The fire eagle stopped struggling, then went over to me. He motioned for me to get onto his back. I got on and we shot towards the surface and out of the lava. We landed in front of the group, who stared. Jake ran over and hugged me. 
	“I thought I lost you!” 
	“Yeah. I’m okay, though.” 
	“But how? You went into the lava!” 
	“I guess I’m immune to fire, including lava.” 
Jake turned to Ash. 
	“Ha! I told you!” 
	“Okay, Harold. You can bring us back to base,” I said. 
	“On it.” 
And with that, we teleported.
